Mini-Football Field Canvases  \n   \u2022 Grab 8\""x10\"" canvases or thick paper.  \n   \u2022 Before the game starts, paint a tiny football field on each one\u2014just a green base, white yard lines, and tiny end zones.  \n   \u2022 Let them dry while you play the first quarter on NFL 25.\n\n2. Live-Art Challenge During Commercials  \n   \u2022 Every time a commercial break hits, pause the game and each person has 90 seconds to add something to someone else\u2019s canvas (a player, logo, mascot, touchdown celebration).  \n   \u2022 Rotate canvases so everyone touches every piece.\n\n3. NFL 25 \u201cArt Draft\u201d Halftime Show  \n   \u2022 At halftime, vote on the best mini-field. Winner gets to pick the next team matchup in NFL 25, but also has to paint a funny \u201cvictory pose\u201d on a blank mini-canvas for the group to keep.\n\n4. Post-Game Collaborative Trophy  \n   \u2022 Save one small wooden plaque (craft-store cheap). After the game ends, everyone paints one small element (football, goal post, confetti) to create a shared \u201cchampionship trophy\u201d the group can display.\n\nSupplies in 10 minutes: small canvases, acrylics, tiny brushes, paper plates for palettes, wet wipes for quick cleanup.
