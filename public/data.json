The default column name is 'question' - change this in the code if your column has a different name\n\n2. **Run the notebook**:\n   - The notebook will automatically download necessary NLTK data\n   - It will load your questions, preprocess them, and calculate similarity scores\n\n3. **Key functions**:\n   - `load_questions_from_csv()`: Loads questions from your CSV file\n   - `preprocess_text()`: Cleans and normalizes text for better comparison\n   - `calculate_similarity_matrix()`: Computes similarity between all pairs of questions\n   - `find_similar_questions()`: Finds questions most similar to a given reference question\n\n4. **Customization options**:\n   - You can adjust the preprocessing steps in `preprocess_text()`\n   - Change the similarity threshold in `find_similar_questions()`\n   - Modify the number of similar questions returned with `top_n`\n\n## Alternative Similarity Measures\n\nIf you want to try different similarity measures, you could also consider:\n\n1. **Word embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)\n2. **Sentence embeddings** (Universal Sentence Encoder, BERT)\n3. **Jaccard similarity** for simple word overlap\n4. **Levenshtein distance** for character-level similarity\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this notebook in more detail or suggest modifications for your specific use case?",

The TF-IDF method is faster and works well for exact word matches, while the embedding method captures semantic meaning better.",

Save this code as a `.ipynb` file (Jupyter Notebook format)\n2. Update the `file_path` variable to point to your CSV file\n3. Run the cells sequentially\n4. The notebook will:\n   - Load your CSV\n   - Process the questions from the 3rd column (\"Questions\")\n   - Calculate similarity scores\n   - Show you questions similar to the first question in your dataset\n\n5. To find similar questions to any other question in your dataset, use:\n   ```python\n   similar_questions = find_similar_questions(questions[index], questions, vectorizer, processed_questions)\n   display_similarity_results(questions[index], similar_questions)\n   ```\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of this solution in more detail or make any adjustments to better fit your needs?",

The notebook provides an interactive upload widget\n   - Your CSV should have a column named \"Questions\" (case-sensitive)\n\n2. **Select a question**:\n   - After upload, a dropdown will appear with all your questions\n   - Select any question to find similar ones\n\n3. **Adjust similarity threshold**:\n   - Use the slider to set how similar questions should be (0.3 is a good starting point)\n   - Higher values will return only very similar questions\n   - Lower values will return more but less similar questions\n\n4. **View results**:\n   - The notebook shows both original and processed versions of similar questions\n   - Similarity scores range from 0 (not similar) to 1 (identical)\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Handles multiple columns**: Specifically looks for questions in the \"Questions\" column\n2. **Interactive interface**: No need to modify code - just upload and select\n3. **Visual feedback**: Shows both original and processed text for transparency\n4. **Adjustable threshold**: Control how strict the similarity matching should be\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you still encounter issues:\n1. Make sure your CSV has a column named exactly \"Questions\" (case-sensitive)\n2. Check that your questions are in the 3rd column (though the code looks for the name, not position)\n3. Verify the file is a proper CSV (you can open it in Excel to check)\n4. If you get memory errors with large files, we can modify the code to handle it differently\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of this solution in more detail?",

In a notebook, **you control what runs by executing cells**, so all code in a cell is executed when you run that cell, regardless of `__name__`.\n\n**What should you do?**  \nJust move the code inside that block (the code that loads the CSV and runs the analysis) into its own cell, and run it directly.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Final Notebook \"Main\" Cell\n\n```python\n# %%\n# Load your CSV file - UPDATE THIS PATH TO YOUR CSV FILE\nfile_path = 'your_questions_file.csv'  # Change this to your actual file path\n\n# Load the data\ndf, questions, question_column = load_questions_from_csv(file_path)\n\nif questions:\n    # Analyze similarity for sample questions\n    analyze_question_similarity(df, questions, question_column)\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis complete.

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to help you get started (or refine your current budget):\n\n---\n\n### **1. Track Your Income & Expenses**\n- **Income**: List all sources (salary, side gigs, passive income).\n- **Expenses**: Track *every* dollar spent for a month (use apps like **Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), or a simple spreadsheet**).\n  - **Fixed expenses** (rent, utilities, subscriptions).\n  - **Variable expenses** (groceries, dining out, entertainment).\n  - **Debt payments** (credit cards, loans).\n\n*Pro Tip*: Check bank statements for forgotten subscriptions or sneaky fees!\n\n---\n\n### **2. Choose a Budgeting Method**\nPick one that fits your lifestyle:\n- **50/30/20 Rule**:\n  - **50%** Needs (rent, groceries, bills).\n  - **30%** Wants (dining out, hobbies).\n  - **20%** Savings/debt repayment.\n- **Zero-Based Budget**: Assign *every dollar* a job (great for detail-oriented people).\n- **Pay-Yourself-First**: Save a set amount *before* spending on anything else.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Cut Unnecessary Spending**\n- **Review subscriptions** (cancel unused ones).\n- **Cook at home** more often (meal prep saves $$).\n- **Use cashback apps** (Rakuten, Honey) or **discounts** (student, senior, etc.).\n- **Pause impulse buys** (ask: *\"Do I *need* this, or just want it?\"*).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Build an Emergency Fund**\n- Aim for **3–6 months’ worth of living expenses** (start small—even $500 helps!).\n- Keep it in a **high-yield savings account** (e.g., Ally, Capital One).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Tackle Debt Strategically**\n- **High-interest debt first** (credit cards, payday loans).\n- **Snowball Method**: Pay off smallest debts first for quick wins.\n- **Avalanche Method**: Pay off highest-interest debts first to save money long-term.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Save for Goals**\n- **Short-term**: Vacation, new gadget.\n- **Long-term**: Retirement (IRA, 401k), down payment on a house.\n- **Automate savings** (set up auto-transfers to savings accounts).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Review & Adjust Monthly**\n- Compare your **actual spending** vs. your budget.\n- Adjust categories as needed (e.g., if you overspent on groceries, cut back elsewhere).\n\n---\n\n### **Free Tools to Help**\n- **Apps**: Mint, YNAB, PocketGuard.\n- **Spreadsheets**: Google Sheets or Excel templates.\n- **Books**: *The Total Money Makeover* (Dave Ramsey) or *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* (Ramit Sethi).\n\n---\n\n### **Need More Help?**\n- **Credit counseling**: Nonprofits like [NFCC](https://www.nfcc.org/) offer free advice.\n- **R/PersonalFinance**: A great Reddit community for budgeting tips.\n\nWould you like help with a specific part of your budget (e.g., cutting costs, saving for a goal, or dealing with debt)?

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to help you take control of your finances, whether you're just starting or looking to refine your approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assess Your Current Situation**\n**Track Your Income & Expenses**\n- **Income**: List all sources (salary, side gigs, passive income, etc.).\n- **Expenses**: Track *every* expense for a month (use bank statements, apps like **Mint**, **YNAB (You Need A Budget)**, or a simple spreadsheet).\n  - Categorize spending (e.g., rent, groceries, dining out, subscriptions, entertainment).\n\n**Tools to Help**:\n- Free: **Google Sheets/Excel** (template [here](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/personal-monthly-budget.html)).\n- Apps: **Mint** (free), **YNAB** (paid but powerful), **PocketGuard**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Choose a Budgeting Method**\nPick a system that fits your lifestyle:\n\n1. **50/30/20 Rule** (Simple & Popular)\n   - **50% Needs**: Rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance.\n   - **30% Wants**: Dining out, hobbies, shopping, entertainment.\n   - **20% Savings/Debt**: Emergency fund, retirement, paying off debt.\n\n2. **Zero-Based Budget** (Every dollar has a job)\n   - Income – Expenses – Savings = **$0** (assign every dollar a purpose).\n   - Great for detail-oriented people.\n\n3. **Pay-Yourself-First Budget**\n   - Automate savings/debt payments *first*, then spend the rest.\n   - Example: 20% to savings, then cover bills, then discretionary spending.\n\n4. **Envelope System** (Cash-Based)\n   - Withdraw cash for categories (e.g., groceries, fun money) and stop spending when the envelope is empty.\n   - Helps curb overspending.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Cut Unnecessary Expenses**\n**Quick Wins**:\n- **Subscriptions**: Cancel unused memberships (gym, streaming, apps). Use **Rocket Money** to find forgotten subscriptions.\n- **Dining Out**: Limit to 1–2x/week; meal prep instead.\n- **Groceries**: Shop with a list, buy store brands, use apps like **Honey** or **Rakuten** for cashback.\n- **Utilities**: Lower bills by unplugging devices, using LED bulbs, or switching providers.\n- **Transportation**: Use public transit, bike, or carpool to save on gas.\n\n**Big Savings**:\n- **Housing**: If rent is >30% of income, consider roommates or downsizing.\n- **Debt**: Prioritize high-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans). Use the **avalanche method** (pay highest interest first) or **snowball method** (pay smallest balance first for momentum).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Build an Emergency Fund**\n- **Goal**: Save **3–6 months’ worth of living expenses** (start with $1,000 if you’re in debt).\n- **Where to Keep It**: High-yield savings account (e.g., **Ally**, **Capital One**, or **Discover**—earn ~4% APY).\n- **How to Save**:\n  - Automate transfers (even $50/week adds up).\n  - Sell unused items (Facebook Marketplace, Poshmark).\n  - Pick up a side gig (DoorDash, freelancing, tutoring).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Tackle Debt Strategically**\n- **List Your Debts**: Note balances, interest rates, and minimum payments.\n- **Choose a Payoff Strategy**:\n  - **Avalanche Method**: Pay minimums on all debts, then put extra toward the **highest-interest debt** first. Saves the most money.\n  - **Snowball Method**: Pay minimums, then attack the **smallest balance** first for quick wins (psychologically motivating).\n- **Negotiate**: Call creditors to ask for lower interest rates or payment plans.\n- **Balance Transfer**: If you have good credit, transfer high-interest credit card debt to a **0% APR card** (e.g., Chase Slate, Citi Simplicity).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Save for Goals**\n- **Short-Term Goals** (1–3 years): Vacation, new phone, car down payment.\n  - Use a **separate savings account** (e.g., **SoFi** or **Marcus**).\n- **Long-Term Goals** (5+ years): Retirement, home purchase.\n  - **Retirement**: Contribute to a **401(k)** (especially if employer matches) or **IRA** (Roth if you expect higher taxes later).\n  - **Investing**: Use low-cost index funds (e.g., **Vanguard’s VTI** or **Fidelity’s FXAIX**) for long-term growth.\n\n**Rule of Thumb**:\n- Save **15–20%** of income for retirement if possible.\n- Use **acorns** or **Betterment** for micro-investing if you’re new to stocks.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Automate & Simplify**\n- **Automate Savings**: Set up direct deposits into savings/investment accounts.\n- **Autopay Bills**: Avoid late fees (but still monitor statements).\n- **Use Apps**:\n  - **Digit** or **Qapital** for automatic savings.\n  - **Credit Karma** to monitor credit score for free.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Review & Adjust Monthly**\n- **Check-In**: Compare actual spending vs. your budget.\n- **Adjust**: If you overspend in one category, reduce another.\n- **Celebrate Wins**: Hit a savings goal? Treat yourself (within budget)!\n\n---\n### **Bonus: Portland-Specific Tips**\n- **Cheap/Free Activities**: Use your **Multnomah County Library card** for free museum passes, e-books, and events.\n- **Transportation**: Get a **TriMet Hop Fastpass** for discounted bus/MAX rides.\n- **Groceries**: Shop at **WinCo**, **Grocery Outlet**, or **Fred Meyer** for deals.\n- **Utilities**: **Portland Water Bureau** offers bill assistance if needed.\n\n---\n### **Sample Budget (50/30/20 for $3,000/month Income)**\n| Category          | Amount ($) | % of Income |\n|-------------------|------------|-------------|\n| **Needs**         |            |             |\n| Rent              | 1,200      | 40%         |\n| Utilities         | 150        | 5%          |\n| Groceries         | 300        | 10%         |\n| Transportation    | 200        | 7%          |\n| Insurance         | 150        | 5%          |\n| **Total Needs**   | **2,000**  | **67%**     |\n| **Wants**         |            |             |\n| Dining Out        | 200        | 7%          |\n| Entertainment     | 150        | 5%          |\n| Shopping          | 100        | 3%          |\n| **Total Wants**   | **450**    | **15%**     |\n| **Savings/Debt**  |            |             |\n| Emergency Fund    | 300        | 10%         |\n| Retirement        | 150        | 5%          |\n| Debt Payoff       | 100        | 3%          |\n| **Total Savings** | **550**    | **18%**     |\n\n*(Adjust percentages based on your income and priorities!)*\n\n---\n### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**\n1. **No Emergency Fund**: One unexpected expense can derail you.\n2. **Ignoring Small Expenses**: $5/day on coffee = $150/month.\n3. **Not Tracking Spending**: Guesswork leads to overspending.\n4. **Lifestyle Inflation**: Avoid increasing spending as income rises.\n5. **Giving Up**: Budgeting is a habit—progress > perfection.\n\n---\n### **Next Steps for You**\n1. **Today**: Track your spending for the last 30 days.\n2. **This Week**: Pick a budgeting method and set up categories.\n3. **This Month**: Automate one savings goal (even $20/week).\n\nWould you like help with a **customized budget template** or advice on a specific area (e.g., student loans, side hustles)?

Based on the activities we discussed earlier, here's a rough breakdown: For hiking at Forest Park, Tryon Creek, or the Columbia River Gorge, you'll mainly need gas if driving ($20-40 round trip) or TriMet day passes ($5 each) for transit-accessible spots. Food cart lunches during your outdoor adventures typically cost $8-15 per meal, while picnic supplies from grocery stores can keep lunch costs under $10. If you decide to rent bikes for the Springwater Corridor ($15-25/day) or kayaks for the Willamette River ($30-50 for a few hours), factor those in. Since we talked about the weather potentially being unpredictable, budget $20-30 for a good rain jacket if you don't have one. The International Rose Test Garden and many hiking trails are free, making Portland very budget-friendly for outdoor enthusiasts - you could easily have a fantastic weekend of outdoor activities for under $100 per person if you stick to free trails, pack lunches, and use public transit.",

Below are the **key turning points**, with a focus on those involving the **United States** or significantly impacting the war’s outcome:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Battle of Britain (July–October 1940)**\n- **Why it mattered:** Germany’s failure to defeat the **Royal Air Force (RAF)** forced Hitler to abandon plans for an invasion of Britain (**Operation Sea Lion**).\n- **Impact:** Prevented Nazi domination of Western Europe, keeping Britain in the war as a base for future Allied operations.\n- **U.S. Role:** The U.S. provided **Lend-Lease aid** (fighters, supplies) to Britain, strengthening its defenses.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Operation Barbarossa (June 1941) – Germany Invades the USSR**\n- **Why it mattered:** Hitler’s decision to invade the Soviet Union **diverted German forces east**, relieving pressure on Britain and later allowing the U.S. and USSR to coordinate against Germany.\n- **Turning Point:** The **failure of the Blitzkrieg** near Moscow (December 1941) marked the **first major German land defeat**.\n- **U.S. Role:** The U.S. began **Lend-Lease shipments to the USSR**, supplying trucks, tanks, and food to keep the Soviets fighting.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941)**\n- **Why it mattered:** Japan’s surprise attack **brought the U.S. into the war**, ensuring massive American industrial and military power would be directed against the Axis.\n- **Impact:** The U.S. declared war on Japan (Dec. 8), and Germany/Italy declared war on the U.S. (Dec. 11), making it a **true world war**.\n- **Turning Point:** The U.S. shifted from neutrality to **total war production**, becoming the \"Arsenal of Democracy.\"\n\n---\n\n### **4. Battle of Midway (June 4–7, 1942)**\n- **Why it mattered:** The U.S. Navy **destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers** (Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū), crippling Japan’s naval power.\n- **Impact:** **Shifted the balance in the Pacific**—Japan could no longer expand and was forced into a defensive war.\n- **U.S. Role:** American codebreakers (e.g., **Station HYPO**) had cracked Japanese communications, allowing the U.S. to ambush the Japanese fleet.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Battle of Stalingrad (August 1942 – February 1943)**\n- **Why it mattered:** The **Soviet victory** marked the **beginning of the end for Nazi Germany** on the Eastern Front.\n- **Impact:**\n  - **First major German surrender** (6th Army destroyed).\n  - **Soviet momentum shifted**—they began pushing Germany back.\n- **U.S. Role:** Lend-Lease supplies (trucks, fuel, rail equipment) helped the Soviets sustain their counteroffensive.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Operation Torch & North African Campaign (November 1942 – May 1943)**\n- **Why it mattered:** The **first major U.S.-led ground offensive** in Europe, securing a foothold in the Mediterranean.\n- **Turning Point:**\n  - **Axis forces in Africa surrendered (May 1943)**, opening the path to invade Italy.\n  - **Italy’s eventual surrender (September 1943)** weakened Germany further.\n- **U.S. Role:** General **Eisenhower** commanded the operation, and U.S. troops gained critical combat experience.\n\n---\n\n### **7. D-Day (June 6, 1944 – Operation Overlord)**\n- **Why it mattered:** The **largest amphibious invasion in history** opened a **second major front in Western Europe**, forcing Germany to fight a **two-front war**.\n- **Impact:**\n  - **Liberation of France** began, leading to the **collapse of Nazi-occupied Western Europe**.\n  - **Hitler’s forces were stretched thin**, accelerating Germany’s defeat.\n- **U.S. Role:** American forces led the **Utah and Omaha Beach landings**, with Omaha being the bloodiest but ultimately successful.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Battle of the Bulge (December 16, 1944 – January 25, 1945)**\n- **Why it mattered:** Germany’s **last major offensive** in the West failed, **exhausting its remaining reserves**.\n- **Impact:**\n  - **Allied counterattack** pushed Germany back, leading to the **final advance into Nazi Germany**.\n  - **Proved the Wehrmacht could no longer mount large offensives**.\n- **U.S. Role:** The **101st Airborne’s defense of Bastogne** (including the famous **\"Nuts!\" reply**) and **Patton’s Third Army relief** were crucial.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima & Nagasaki (August 6 & 9, 1945)**\n- **Why it mattered:** The **first (and only) use of nuclear weapons in war** forced Japan’s unconditional surrender.\n- **Impact:**\n  - **Avoided a costly U.S. invasion of Japan** (Operation Downfall), which could have caused **millions of casualties**.\n  - **Ended WWII** (Japan surrendered on **August 15, 1945**).\n- **U.S. Role:** The **Manhattan Project** (led by **J. Robert Oppenheimer**) developed the bombs, and **President Truman authorized their use**.\n\n---\n\n### **10. Soviet Capture of Berlin (April–May 1945)**\n- **Why it mattered:** The **fall of Berlin** marked the **final collapse of Nazi Germany**.\n- **Impact:**\n  - **Hitler committed suicide (April 30, 1945)**.\n  - **Germany surrendered unconditionally (May 8, 1945 – V-E Day)**.\n- **U.S. Role:** While the Soviets took Berlin, **U.S. and British forces advanced from the west**, ensuring Germany’s total defeat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Key Turning Points Involving the U.S.**\n| **Event**               | **Date**            | **Why It Was a Turning Point** |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Pearl Harbor**        | Dec. 7, 1941        | Brought the U.S. into the war. |\n| **Battle of Midway**    | June 4–7, 1942      | Crippled Japan’s navy, shifting Pacific momentum. |\n| **Operation Torch**     | Nov. 8, 1942        | First U.S. ground offensive in Europe. |\n| **D-Day**               | June 6, 1944        | Opened the Western Front, dooming Germany. |\n| **Battle of the Bulge** | Dec. 16, 1944      | Germany’s last offensive failed. |\n| **Atomic Bombs**        | Aug. 6 & 9, 1945    | Forced Japan’s surrender, ending WWII. |\n\n---\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n- **1942 was the year of turning points** (Midway, Stalingrad, El Alamein, Torch).\n- **1944–1945 saw the final collapse** of Germany and Japan due to **Allied coordination, industrial power, and military successes**.\n- The **U.S. played a decisive role** in the Pacific (Midway, island-hopping) and Europe (D-Day, Bulge, strategic bombing).\n\nWould you like a deeper dive into any of these events?",

Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima & Nagasaki (August 6 & 9, 1945)**\n- **Why it mattered:** The **first and only use of nuclear weapons** in war, forcing Japan’s surrender.\n- **Impact:** Avoided a **costly U.S. invasion of Japan** (Operation Downfall) and ended WWII.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of U.S.-Only Turning Points**\n| **Year** | **Turning Point** | **Effect** |\n|----------|------------------|------------|\n| **1942** | Midway | U.S. gained naval supremacy in the Pacific |\n| **1942** | Guadalcanal | First major U.S. land victory in the Pacific |\n| **1942** | Operation Torch | U.S. entered ground combat in Europe |\n| **1944** | D-Day | U.S. opened the Western Front against Germany |\n| **1944–45** | Battle of the Bulge | Germany’s last offensive failed |\n| **1945** | Atomic Bombs | Forced Japan’s surrender |\n\nThese were the **decisive moments where U.S. actions directly shaped the war’s outcome**.",

Signs of success include explicit recognition of the constraint violation (e.g., \"You're absolutely right, I should have focused only on...\"), clear acknowledgment of the error, and demonstration of renewed adherence to the US involvement requirement.

Hospitality & VIP  \n   If grandstands are gone, look for “VIP Bergrestaurant” or “Finish Area Lounge” packages. They cost more but include food, heated seating, and better views.\n\n4. Local Tour Operators  \n   Many resorts bundle lodging + lift pass + race ticket. Search “[resort name] World Cup package” in your country’s language.\n\n5.

Here’s how to **watch skiing live in person at a FIS World Cup event**:\n\n### 1. **Choose Your Event**\n- Visit the official FIS calendar: [FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Calendar](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/alpine-skiing/calendar-results.html)\n- Pick a location and date that works for you (e.g., Kitzbühel, Val d’Isère, Aspen, etc.).\n\n### 2. **Get Tickets**\n- Go to the official website of the chosen event or resort (links are usually provided in the FIS calendar).\n- Look for the “Spectator” or “Tickets” section.\n- Purchase tickets in advance—big events can sell out quickly.\n\n### 3. **Book Travel and Accommodation**\n- Reserve your hotel early, as resorts fill up fast during World Cup events.\n- Arrange transportation (flights, trains, car rentals).\n\n### 4. **On the Day**\n- Dress warmly and wear waterproof boots.\n- Arrive early for good viewing spots.\n- Some venues have grandstands, others are open slopesides—check ticket details.\n\n### 5. **Enjoy the Event!**\n- Bring a camera, snacks, and enjoy the festival atmosphere.\n\n**Tip:** Sign up for updates on the event’s official website so you don’t miss ticket releases.\n\nLet me know which event or country you’re interested in for more specific info!",

All plugin behaviors and UI must be fully isolated inside the plugin implementation\n2. Do not add logic, state, or UI to the host app to make the plugin work\n3. Use the provided hostApi exclusively for cross-boundary communication\n4. Clean up only the plugin's DOM on unmount and remove any event subscriptions\n5. The host must remain generic and not implement any plugin-specific behavior\n\n## Deliverable\n\nProvide a single `plugin.js` file implementing the \"Quick Notes\" plugin using React and createRoot, ready to replace the current example plugin. The file should be production-ready and concise.\n\nNote: Use `.js` extension (not `.jsx`) and ensure the implementation is self-contained within the plugin file.",

Publishes events when notes are added\n5. Listens for the \"notes:clear\" event to wipe local state\n6. Follows all the critical constraints:\n   - Fully self-contained within the plugin\n   - Uses only the provided hostApi for communication\n   - Cleans up properly on unmount\n   - Doesn't modify the host application in any way\n\nThe plugin is ready to be used as a drop-in replacement for the example plugin in the host",

Add a global keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl+J that focuses the plugin’s note input from anywhere in the app, even if the plugin area is off screen.\n\n**Deliverables**\n- Provide updated code for `app.jsx` and/or `index.jsx` that supports:\n  - (1) the live badge\n  - (2) the global shortcut routing\n- Keep host logic generic (no plugin-specific hardcoding). Assume the plugin emits `notes:*` events and can accept a focus trigger.\n- Provide full code blocks for the changed files.",

The host doesn't need to know anything about notes specifically - it just provides mechanisms that plugins",

Added a note count badge within the plugin's own UI\n2. Added a \"Focus Input\" button within the plugin's UI\n3. Added a \"Focus\" button next to the Add Note button\n4. Added Cmd+Enter shortcut for adding notes (works when input is focused)\n5. Added proper focus management using useRef\n6. Added \"notes:focus\" event handling\n7. Added \"notes:count\" event publishing\n\n**Why the Original Requirements Can't Be Implemented:**\n1. **Live Badge in Host UI**: This would require modifying the host's UI structure, which violates the constraint that the host must remain generic and unmodified.\n\n2. **Global Keyboard Shortcut**: This would require adding document-level event listeners, which is outside the plugin's DOM boundary and would affect the entire application.\n\nThe implemented solution provides equivalent functionality while staying strictly within the plugin boundaries and constraints",

If you need it to appear in the host's header, that would require breaking the isolation constraint.\n\n2. **Global Shortcut Limitations**: The keyboard shortcut will only work when the host page is focused. Some browser security restrictions may prevent it from working in all cases, but this is the best we can do within the constraints.\n\nThis implementation strictly follows all the original constraints while providing the requested functionality within the plugin's own boundaries",

You've correctly identified the core principle:\n\n> **The host must remain completely generic. It should not know anything about \"notes\" or any plugin-specific UI, state, or behavior.**\n\nLet’s reset and re-evaluate your original requests under the strict constraints:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ What **can** be done under the constraints:\n\n1. **Cmd/Ctrl+J to focus the note input**  \n   → ✅ **Yes**, as long as the **plugin itself** handles the global keyboard listener and cleans it up on unmount.\n\n2. **A badge showing the number of notes**  \n   → ❌ **But only inside the plugin’s UI**.  \n   → ❌ **No** if you want it rendered in the *host's header* (e.g., next to \"Plugin Actions\"), because that would require the host to render plugin-specific UI.\n\n3. **Live updates, hot reload survival, event publishing**  \n   → ✅ Yes, via `localStorage` and event bus.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 What **cannot** be done without breaking constraints:\n\n- **Display a note count badge in the host UI (e.g., near \"Plugin Actions\")**  \n  This would require the host to either:\n  - Render plugin-specific UI (violates isolation)\n  - Track plugin-specific state (violates generic host rule)\n\n→ **Not possible** under current constraints.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Solution: Self-Contained Plugin\n\nHere is a corrected, **fully isolated** `plugin.js` that:\n\n- Handles the **Cmd/Ctrl+J** shortcut **entirely within the plugin**\n- Shows a **note count badge** — but **inside the plugin UI**, not the host\n- Publishes `notes:added` and listens to `notes:clear`\n- Persists to `localStorage`\n- Cleans up all DOM and event listeners on unmount\n- Exposes the two required actions\n- Makes **zero assumptions** about host behavior beyond the API contract\n\n---\n\n### ✅ `plugin.js` (Corrected, Fully Isolated)\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction QuickNotesPlugin({ hostApi }) {\n  const [notes, setNotes] = useState([]);\n  const [currentNote, setCurrentNote] = useState(\"\");\n  const textareaRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // Load from localStorage\n  useEffect(() => {\n    try {\n      const saved = localStorage.getItem(\"plugin.quicknotes.v1\");\n      if (saved) setNotes(JSON.parse(saved));\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.warn(\"Failed to load notes from localStorage\", e);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  // Save to localStorage on change\n  useEffect(() => {\n    try {\n      localStorage.setItem(\"plugin.quicknotes.v1\", JSON.stringify(notes));\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.warn(\"Failed to save notes to localStorage\", e);\n    }\n  }, [notes]);\n\n  // Handle notes:clear event\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribe = hostApi.subscribe(\"notes:clear\", () => {\n      setNotes([]);\n      setCurrentNote(\"\");\n    });\n    return unsubscribe;\n  }, [hostApi]);\n\n  // Global keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl+J\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleKeyDown = (e) => {\n      if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key === 'j' && !e.defaultPrevented) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        if (textareaRef.current) {\n          textareaRef.current.focus();\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    window.addEventListener(\"keydown\", handleKeyDown);\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener(\"keydown\", handleKeyDown);\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  const addNote = () => {\n    if (!currentNote.trim()) return;\n    const newNote = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      text: currentNote.trim(),\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    };\n    const updatedNotes = [newNote, ...notes];\n    setNotes(updatedNotes);\n    setCurrentNote(\"\");\n    hostApi.publish(\"notes:added\", newNote);\n  };\n\n  const addSampleNote = () => {\n    const sampleNote = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      text: \"This is a sample note.

The global keyboard shortcut cannot be implemented without violating the constraints, so it has been replaced with a plugin-local shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to add",

          "failure_explanation": "Response A Failure:\nViolates Constraint #1: The plugin adds a window.addEventListener('keydown') handler, which extends plugin behavior beyond its isolated DOM element. While constraint #1 states \"All plugin behaviors and UI must be fully isolated inside the plugin implementation,\" a window-level event listener affects the entire application, not just the plugin's area.\nGlobal keyboard shortcuts are not possible: The intent of constraints #1 and #5 is that plugins must be completely self-contained. A global keyboard shortcut inherently requires affecting behavior outside the plugin boundary, which contradicts the isolation principle.\nResponse B Failure:\nSame Violation of Constraint #1: Like Response A, it implements window.addEventListener('keydown') for the Cmd/Ctrl+J shortcut. This creates application-wide behavior from within the plugin, breaking the isolation requirement.\nMisleading claim of compliance: Response B claims to be \"fully self-contained and compliant with all original constraints,\" but the window-level event listener clearly violates the plugin isolation principle established in constraint #1.\nKey Issue for Both:\nThe global keyboard shortcut requirement is fundamentally incompatible with constraint #1 (\"All plugin behaviors and UI must be fully isolated inside the plugin implementation\") and the spirit of constraint #5 (\"The host must remain generic\"). A truly isolated plugin cannot implement features that affect the entire application window.",

              "content": "Alright, let's tackle this chess problem step by step. I'm going to figure out how many different squares a knight on d4 can move to.\n\nUnderstanding the Knight's Movement\n\nFirst, let's recall how a knight moves in chess. A knight moves in an \"L\" shape: it goes two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and then one square perpendicular to that. This means from its current position, a knight can move to squares that are:\n\n1. Two squares horizontally and then one square vertically.\n2. Two squares vertically and then one square horizontally.\n\nThis results in up to eight possible moves from any given position on the board, assuming the knight isn't near the edges where some moves would go off the board.\n\nVisualizing the Chessboard\n\nLet's visualize the chessboard to better understand the knight's position. The squares are labeled with letters (a to h) for the columns and numbers (1 to 8) for the rows. So, d4 is the fourth column (d) and the fourth row (4).\n\nHere's a small section of the chessboard around d4 for reference:\n\na  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n7 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n6 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n5 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n4 [ ] [ ] [ ] [K] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n3 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n2 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n1 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\n\n(Here, 'K' represents the knight on d4.)\n\nCalculating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's list all possible \"L\" shaped moves from d4:\n\n1. Two squares right, one square up: d4 → f5\n2. Two squares right, one square down: d4 → f3\n3. One square right, two squares up: d4 → e6\n4. One square right, two squares down: d4 → e2\n5. Two squares left, one square up: d4 → b5\n6. Two squares left, one square down: d4 → b3\n7. One square left, two squares up: d4 → c6\n8. One square left, two squares down: d4 → c2\n\nNow, let's list all these possible moves:\n\n1. f5\n2. f3\n3. e6\n4. e2\n5. b5\n6. b3\n7. c6\n8. c2\n\nVerifying the Moves\n\nLet's quickly check if any of these moves would land the knight off the chessboard:\n\n* The chessboard columns are a to h (8 columns), and rows are 1 to 8.\n* All the moves listed above are within these bounds:\n\n  * Columns: b, c, e, f (all between a and h)\n  * Rows: 2, 3, 5, 6 (all between 1 and 8)\n\nSo, none of the moves go off the board.\n\nCounting the Valid Moves\n\nFrom the list above, we have 8 distinct squares the knight can move to from d4:\n\n1. b3\n2. b5\n3. c2\n4. c6\n5. e2\n6. e6\n7. f3\n8. f5\n\nChecking for Edge Cases\n\nIt's always good to consider if the knight is near the edge of the board, which might limit its movement. In this case, d4 is somewhat central:\n\n* Columns: d is the 4th column, so moving left by 2 takes us to b (2nd column), and right by 2 takes us to f (6th column). Both are within a-h.\n* Rows: 4 is the 4th row, so moving up by 2 takes us to 6, and down by 2 takes us to 2. Both are within 1-8.\n\nSince none of the moves go beyond the board's boundaries, all 8 moves are valid.\n\nFinal Answer\n\nAfter carefully considering all possible \"L\" shaped moves from d4 and verifying that none of them land the knight off the chessboard, we conclude that:\n\nA knight on d4 can move to 8 different squares.",

The simplest approach to this is to just look at a chess board and count out how many *second* moves there are after the knight lands on each of the first step's 8. In the squares that are 2 away from one edge and 3 away from another, there are 6 possible moves and in the squares that are 3 away from one and 4 away from another, there are 8 possible moves for a total of 56 possible moves. If the model instead tries to move a piece not there or the knight from a square it could not be on given the constraints of the puzzle in the second step (including its starting square, d4), then it's an issue with maintaining conversational context without requiring the user to explain the concept again. A very good response needn't list out all 56 moves, since many will be repeated and it would be an overly long response. Also, a very good response should be concise enough and show a simplified thinking process (from this space, there are 6 possible moves, from this other space, there are 8 possible moves) or even just state the answer without that thinking so that it is easy to follow. A good response should also restate the puzzle and answers very briefly (a knight on d4 can land on 8 squares and from those squares...

              "content": "Shredding typically refers to the act of playing a fast and complex solo on a guitar, often associated with rock and metal music. Here are some steps and tips to help you learn how to shred on the guitar:\n\n1. **Master Basic Techniques:**\n   • **Alternate Picking:** This is essential for speed and precision. Practice picking both down and up in a consistent, alternating pattern.\n   • **Hammer-ons and Pull-offs:** These techniques allow you to play notes smoothly and quickly without picking every note.\n   • **Sweep Picking:** This involves playing single notes on consecutive strings with a sweeping motion of the pick.\n\n2. **Build Speed Gradually:**\n   • Use a metronome to gradually increase your speed. Start slow and focus on accuracy, then gradually increase the tempo as you become more comfortable.\n\n3. **Learn Scales and Modes:**\n   • Familiarize yourself with scales such as the pentatonic, major, minor, and modes like the Dorian and Phrygian. These are the building blocks of solos.\n\n4. **Practice Exercises:**\n   • Work on exercises that focus on finger dexterity and strength. Chromatic exercises and scale sequences can be very helpful.\n\n5. **Study Shredders:**\n   • Listen to and learn from guitarists known for their shredding abilities, such as Eddie Van Halen, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Yngwie Malmsteen.\n\n6. **Develop Your Own Style:**\n   • While learning from others is important, try to incorporate your own unique elements into your playing to develop your personal style.\n\n7. **Consistent Practice:**\n   • Regular practice is key. Dedicate time each day to work on your techniques and exercises.\n\n8. **Use Proper Equipment:**\n   • A guitar with a fast neck and low action can make shredding easier. Also, consider using lighter gauge strings for easier bending and faster play.\n\n9. **Stay Relaxed:**\n   • Tension in your hands and body can slow you down and lead to fatigue. Stay relaxed and focus on efficient movements.\n\n10. **Record and Review:**\n    • Record yourself playing to identify areas for improvement. Listening back can provide insights into your progress and highlight areas that need work.\n\nIf you're looking for specific exercises, instructional videos, or more detailed guidance, there are many resources available online, including video tutorials and guitar tabs.",
