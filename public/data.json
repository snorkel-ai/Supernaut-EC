In practice, you might want to:\n1. Consider relaxing the constraint for complex rendering functions\n2. Move the Rich imports to module level if lazy-loading isn't critical\n3. Break down the most complex statements into helper functions if maintainability is a priority\n\nWould you like me to suggest any alternative approaches that might balance strictness with readability? For example, we could:\n- Use a decorator pattern for lazy imports\n- Create a separate module for Rich-related functions\n- Implement a builder pattern for complex rendering operations\n\nThe current implementation strictly follows your requirements while maintaining all functionality.",

Each host resort runs its own ticket portal; links are posted there.\n\n2. Host Resort Site  \n   Once the venue is announced (e.g., Kitzb\u00fchel, Wengen, Bormio), go straight to that resort\u2019s site. Grandstand tickets for downhill or slalom sell out first\u2014buy as soon as sales open.\n\n3. Hospitality & VIP  \n   If grandstands are gone, look for \u201cVIP Bergrestaurant\u201d or \u201cFinish Area Lounge\u201d packages. They cost more but include food, heated seating, and better views.\n\n4. Local Tour Operators  \n   Many resorts bundle lodging + lift pass + race ticket. Search \u201c[resort name] World Cup package\u201d in your country\u2019s language.\n\n5. Secondary Market  \n   Official resellers like Ticombo or fanSALE sometimes have last-minute returns. Avoid general scalper sites; fake ski-race tickets are common.\n\nTip: Weekday races are easier tickets than weekends.",

              "content": "A **dirt bike** is a lightweight, off-road motorcycle designed for rough terrain, such as dirt trails, motocross tracks, and desert riding. Unlike street bikes, dirt bikes lack features like headlights, turn signals, and mirrors (unless modified for dual-sport use). Here's a breakdown of key aspects:\\n\\n### **1. Types of Dirt Bikes**\\n- **Motocross (MX) Bikes** – Built for racing on closed tracks with jumps and tight turns. High-performance, lightweight, and often require frequent maintenance.\\n- **Enduro Bikes** – Street-legal (or easily convertible) dirt bikes designed for long-distance off-road riding. They have lights, a quieter exhaust, and a more comfortable seat.\\n- **Trail Bikes** – Versatile for casual off-road riding, with a balance of power and ease of use.\\n- **Dual-Sport Bikes** – Street-legal dirt bikes that can be ridden on both pavement and trails.\\n- **Pit Bikes** – Small, lightweight bikes often used for fun or training.\\n\\n### **2. Key Features**\\n- **Engine Size**: Ranges from **50cc** (for kids) to **450cc+** (for adults and pros).\\n- **Suspension**: Long-travel suspension to absorb jumps and rough terrain.\\n- **Tires**: Knobby tires for grip on dirt, mud, and rocks.\\n- **Weight**: Lightweight (often under **250 lbs**) for better handling.\\n- **Frame**: Typically made of steel or aluminum for durability.\\n\\n### **3. Popular Brands**\\n- **Honda** (CRF series)\\n- **Yamaha** (YZ, WR series)\\n- **Kawasaki** (KX, KLX series)\\n- **KTM** (SX, EXC series)\\n- **Suzuki** (RM-Z series)\\n- **Beta** (Enduro-focused)\\n\\n### **4. Riding Styles**\\n- **Motocross (MX)** – High-speed racing on closed tracks with jumps.\\n- **Enduro** – Long-distance off-road racing with natural obstacles.\\n- **Trail Riding** – Casual off-road exploration.\\n- **Freestyle Motocross (FMX)** – Trick riding with jumps and stunts.\\n\\n### **5. Safety Gear**\\n- **Helmet** (DOT or Snell certified)\\n- **Goggles** (to protect from dust and debris)\\n- **Boots** (ankle support and protection)\\n- **Gloves** (grip and hand protection)\\n- **Chest Protector & Knee Guards** (for high-impact riding)\\n- **Neck Brace** (optional but recommended for aggressive riding)\\n\\n### **6. Maintenance Tips**\\n- **Clean the Air Filter** (dirt bikes get clogged easily).\\n- **Check Tire Pressure** (low pressure improves traction).\\n- **Oil Changes** (frequent due to high-stress riding).\\n- **Chain Lubrication** (prevents wear and rust).\\n\\n### **7. Getting Started**\\n- **Beginner Bikes**: Honda CRF250F, Yamaha TT-R230, Kawasaki KLX140.\\n- **Training**: Take a dirt bike course or ride with experienced riders.\\n- **Practice**: Start on easy trails before attempting jumps or races.\\n\\n**8. Choosing the Right Dirt Bike**\\n- **For Beginners**: Opt for a **250cc 4-stroke** or **125cc 2-stroke** for manageable power and easier handling. Examples: *Honda CRF250F, Yamaha TT-R230, or KTM 250 XC-F*.\\n- **For Intermediate Riders**: Consider a **350cc–450cc** for more power and advanced suspension. Examples: *Kawasaki KX450, Suzuki RM-Z450*.\\n- **For Kids**: Smaller bikes like the *Honda CRF50F* or *KTM 50 SX* are ideal for young riders.\\n- **For Racing**: High-performance models like the *Yamaha YZ450F* or *KTM 450 SX-F* are built for competition.\\n\\n**9. Modifications & Upgrades**\\n- **Exhaust Systems**: Aftermarket exhausts (e.g., *FMF, Yoshimura*) improve performance and sound.\\n- **Suspension Tuning**: Adjusting forks and shocks for rider weight and terrain.\\n- **Tires**: Different tread patterns for sand, mud, or hard-pack trails.\\n- **Graphics & Plastics**: Custom kits for a personalized look.\\n\\n**10. Legal Considerations**\\n- **Off-Road Use**: Most dirt bikes are not street-legal unless converted (adding lights, mirrors, DOT tires, etc.).\\n- **Noise Regulations**: Some trails require spark arrestors to comply with noise limits.\\n- **Registration & Insurance**: Dual-sport bikes need proper licensing and insurance for road use.\\n\\n**11. Where to Ride**\\n- **Motocross Tracks**: Private or public tracks for racing and practice.\\n- **Trail Systems**: National forests, OHV parks, and designated off-road areas.\\n- **Desert & Dunes**: Open terrain for high-speed riding (e.g., *Glamis Dunes, California*).\\n- **Enduro Events**: Organized races with varied terrain challenges.\\n\\n**12. Common Mistakes to Avoid**\\n- **Skipping Gear**: Riding without proper protection increases injury risk.\\n- **Overestimating Skill**: Jumping into advanced terrain too soon can lead to crashes.\\n- **Neglecting Maintenance**: Dirt bikes require more frequent upkeep than street bikes.\\n- **Ignoring Bike Setup**: Incorrect tire pressure or suspension settings can ruin handling.\\n\\n**13. Joining the Community**\\n- **Clubs & Groups**: Local riding clubs offer trail access and group rides.\\n- **Online Forums**: Websites like *Vital MX* or *ThumperTalk* provide tips and reviews.\\n- **Racing Leagues**: Amateur motocross or enduro events for competitive riders.\\n\\nWould you like recommendations for specific models, gear, or riding techniques?

It may refer to the physical symptoms experienced during sudden withdrawal (such as goosebumps, which resemble cold turkey skin), or it might come from the idea of something being straightforward and unprepared, like serving cold turkey meat.\n\n**Usage in Portuguese:**  \nIf you need to explain or translate this phrase to Portuguese (in Portugal or Brazil), you could say:\n\n- **Parar de repente** (to stop suddenly)\n- **Parar de uma vez** (to stop all at once)\n- **Parar de forma abrupta** (to stop abruptly)\n\nThere is no exact idiomatic equivalent in Portuguese, but these phrases convey the meaning.

All plugin behaviors and UI must be fully isolated inside the plugin implementation\n2. Do not add logic, state, or UI to the host app to make the plugin work\n3. Use the provided hostApi exclusively for cross-boundary communication\n4. Clean up only the plugin's DOM on unmount and remove any event subscriptions\n5. The host must remain generic and not implement any plugin-specific behavior\n\n## Deliverable\n\nProvide a single `plugin.js` file implementing the \"Quick Notes\" plugin using React and createRoot, ready to replace the current example plugin. The file should be production-ready and concise.\n\nNote: Use `.js` extension (not `.jsx`) and ensure the implementation is self-contained within the plugin file.",

The host doesn't need to know anything about notes specifically - it just provides mechanisms that plugins",

Added a note count badge within the plugin's own UI\n2. Added a \"Focus Input\" button within the plugin's UI\n3. Added a \"Focus\" button next to the Add Note button\n4. Added Cmd+Enter shortcut for adding notes (works when input is focused)\n5. Added proper focus management using useRef\n6. Added \"notes:focus\" event handling\n7. Added \"notes:count\" event publishing\n\n**Why the Original Requirements Can't Be Implemented:**\n1. **Live Badge in Host UI**: This would require modifying the host's UI structure, which violates the constraint that the host must remain generic and unmodified.\n\n2. **Global Keyboard Shortcut**: This would require adding document-level event listeners, which is outside the plugin's DOM boundary and would affect the entire application.\n\nThe implemented solution provides equivalent functionality while staying strictly within the plugin boundaries and constraints",

If you need it to appear in the host's header, that would require breaking the isolation constraint.\n\n2. **Global Shortcut Limitations**: The keyboard shortcut will only work when the host page is focused. Some browser security restrictions may prevent it from working in all cases, but this is the best we can do within the constraints.\n\nThis implementation strictly follows all the original constraints while providing the requested functionality within the plugin's own boundaries",

I did overstep the original constraints by allowing plugin-specific state and behavior to leak into the host.

It should not know anything about \"notes\" or any plugin-specific UI, state, or behavior.**\n\nLet\u2019s reset and re-evaluate your original requests under the strict constraints:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What **can** be done under the constraints:\n\n1. **Cmd/Ctrl+J to focus the note input**  \n   \u2192 \u2705 **Yes**, as long as the **plugin itself** handles the global keyboard listener and cleans it up on unmount.\n\n2. **A badge showing the number of notes**  \n   \u2192 \u274c **But only inside the plugin\u2019s UI**.  \n   \u2192 \u274c **No** if you want it rendered in the *host's header* (e.g., next to \"Plugin Actions\"), because that would require the host to render plugin-specific UI.\n\n3. **Live updates, hot reload survival, event publishing**  \n   \u2192 \u2705 Yes, via `localStorage` and event bus.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab What **cannot** be done without breaking constraints:\n\n- **Display a note count badge in the host UI (e.g., near \"Plugin Actions\")**  \n  This would require the host to either:\n  - Render plugin-specific UI (violates isolation)\n  - Track plugin-specific state (violates generic host rule)\n\n\u2192 **Not possible** under current constraints.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Solution: Self-Contained Plugin\n\nHere is a corrected, **fully isolated** `plugin.js` that:\n\n- Handles the **Cmd/Ctrl+J** shortcut **entirely within the plugin**\n- Shows a **note count badge** \u2014 but **inside the plugin UI**, not the host\n- Publishes `notes:added` and listens to `notes:clear`\n- Persists to `localStorage`\n- Cleans up all DOM and event listeners on unmount\n- Exposes the two required actions\n- Makes **zero assumptions** about host behavior beyond the API contract\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 `plugin.js` (Corrected, Fully Isolated)\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction QuickNotesPlugin({ hostApi }) {\n  const [notes, setNotes] = useState([]);\n  const [currentNote, setCurrentNote] = useState(\"\");\n  const textareaRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // Load from localStorage\n  useEffect(() => {\n    try {\n      const saved = localStorage.getItem(\"plugin.quicknotes.v1\");\n      if (saved) setNotes(JSON.parse(saved));\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.warn(\"Failed to load notes from localStorage\", e);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  // Save to localStorage on change\n  useEffect(() => {\n    try {\n      localStorage.setItem(\"plugin.quicknotes.v1\", JSON.stringify(notes));\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.warn(\"Failed to save notes to localStorage\", e);\n    }\n  }, [notes]);\n\n  // Handle notes:clear event\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribe = hostApi.subscribe(\"notes:clear\", () => {\n      setNotes([]);\n      setCurrentNote(\"\");\n    });\n    return unsubscribe;\n  }, [hostApi]);\n\n  // Global keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl+J\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleKeyDown = (e) => {\n      if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key === 'j' && !e.defaultPrevented) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        if (textareaRef.current) {\n          textareaRef.current.focus();\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    window.addEventListener(\"keydown\", handleKeyDown);\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener(\"keydown\", handleKeyDown);\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  const addNote = () => {\n    if (!currentNote.trim()) return;\n    const newNote = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      text: currentNote.trim(),\n      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    };\n    const updatedNotes = [newNote, ...notes];\n    setNotes(updatedNotes);\n    setCurrentNote(\"\");\n    hostApi.publish(\"notes:added\", newNote);\n  };\n\n  const addSampleNote = () => {\n    const sampleNote = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      text: \"This is a sample note.

The global keyboard shortcut cannot be implemented without violating the constraints, so it has been replaced with a plugin-local shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to add",

          "failure_explanation": "Response A Failure:\nViolates Constraint #1: The plugin adds a window.addEventListener('keydown') handler, which extends plugin behavior beyond its isolated DOM element. While constraint #1 states \"All plugin behaviors and UI must be fully isolated inside the plugin implementation,\" a window-level event listener affects the entire application, not just the plugin's area.\nGlobal keyboard shortcuts are not possible: The intent of constraints #1 and #5 is that plugins must be completely self-contained. A global keyboard shortcut inherently requires affecting behavior outside the plugin boundary, which contradicts the isolation principle.\nResponse B Failure:\nSame Violation of Constraint #1: Like Response A, it implements window.addEventListener('keydown') for the Cmd/Ctrl+J shortcut. This creates application-wide behavior from within the plugin, breaking the isolation requirement.\nMisleading claim of compliance: Response B claims to be \"fully self-contained and compliant with all original constraints,\" but the window-level event listener clearly violates the plugin isolation principle established in constraint #1.\nKey Issue for Both:\nThe global keyboard shortcut requirement is fundamentally incompatible with constraint #1 (\"All plugin behaviors and UI must be fully isolated inside the plugin implementation\") and the spirit of constraint #5 (\"The host must remain generic\"). A truly isolated plugin cannot implement features that affect the entire application window.",

It is financed by the **Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia** and has attracted significant attention and controversy within the golf world.\n\n### **Name Origin**\n- The name \"LIV\" refers to the **Roman numeral 54**. In golf, 54 is the score if every hole on a par-72 course is birdied, and it also reflects the 54-hole format used in LIV Golf events (as opposed to the traditional 72 holes in PGA Tour events).\n\n### **Format & Structure**\n- **Team & Individual Play:** Each event features both individual and team competitions, with teams captained by star players.\n- **54 Holes:** Each tournament is played over three days (54 holes), with no cut.\n- **Shotgun Start:** All players begin at the same time on different holes, rather than traditional tee times.\n- **Limited Fields:** Typically 48 players compete per event.\n\n### **Founding & Funding**\n- **Backed by:** Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund.\n- **CEO:** Greg Norman, former world #1 golfer.\n- **Launch:** First tournament was held in June 2022 near London.\n\n### **Controversy & Criticism**\n- **Sportswashing:** The tour has been criticized for being an attempt by Saudi Arabia to \"sportswash\" its human rights record.\n- **PGA Tour Conflict:** Many prominent golfers (e.g., Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith) joined LIV Golf, leading to suspensions and bans from the PGA Tour.\n- **Legal Disputes:** There have been lawsuits between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour.\n\n### **Impact on Professional Golf**\n- LIV Golf has disrupted the traditional landscape of professional golf, prompting the PGA Tour and DP World Tour to consider changes and, in 2023, announcing a framework agreement for a potential merger (details are still being negotiated as of 2024).\n\n### **Key Points**\n- **Big Purses:** LIV Golf offers some of the highest prize money in golf.\n- **Global Events:** The tour hosts tournaments around the world.\n- **Star Power:** Has attracted several major champions and high-profile players.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like more details about specific events, players, or the latest news, just ask!",
